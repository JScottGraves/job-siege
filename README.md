## Introduction

Job Siege is a tool for job seekers to automate aspects of looking for jobs online.  HR departments have bot armies on their side. Job Siege is your bot army.

## Design Goals

Job seekers spend on average 11 hours a week applying for jobs online & yet cold applying is one of the least likely way to get a job. If you are out of work, you feel like you have to to do it even though you know 90% of the time you put into it will come to nothing.

AI agents have made it harder than ever to get your resume in front of a real human to read. It's only fair that job seekers have some bots on their side too. Here are my design goals:

* Free & open source
* Cut the amount of time you spend searching for and applying for jobs by 90%.  Ideally, you only spend an hour a week on online job hunting while maintaining the same application rate.
* Still effective using small, local LLMs (inference is expensive!)
